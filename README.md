# Athena
## Description
Project Athena is an Artificially Intelligent Personal Assistant that has more of a human touch. It joins in on conversations (depending on the mode), greets and says goodbye properly while also giving useful information on its own depending on checks. It uses NLP to have conversations with its users and form sentences when asked questions etc. You are welcome to contribute, by adding any APIs you'd like in order to further the AI's abilities or fix any issues/bugs you may find.
###### This is heavily inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man.
